Configuration files
=====

This repo contains several configurations used by me on a daily basis. Such as:
- git related configurations (configuration of tools, of the base commit message, gitignore and so on)
- a bashrc (no longer in use), with a bashcolors script
- a screenrc (no longer in use)
- a tmux.conf
- a vimrc, containing my standard vim configuration
- a zshrc
